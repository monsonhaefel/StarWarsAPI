//  returned by the StarWarsAPI REST methods.  Although all of the model objects
//  include the properties url, created, and edited these could not be put into
//  an inherited super class (e.g. Model) becuase the new JSON Codable API
//  does not support inherited properites. Only properties declared in the object
//  to which the encoding is done will be mapped to the JSON.
